2. **Server-Client Architecture:**
The project is structured with a server-client setup, enabling seamless communication between the chatbot and users.
3. **Scalability:**
The architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing multiple clients to interact with the chatbot simultaneously.
4. **Customizable Responses:**
Users can customize the chatbot's responses and train it to handle specific tasks or domains.
5. **Easy Deployment:**
With Python as the primary programming language, deployment and setup of the chatbot are straightforward.

## Usage:

1. **Server Setup:**
Run the server script to initialize the chatbot server.
2. **Client Interaction:**
Connect clients to the server to interact with the chatbot.
3. **Conversation:**
Engage in conversations with the chatbot, ask questions, and receive responses in real-time.
